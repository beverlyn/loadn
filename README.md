## 🌱 Background
As my inaugural venture into the realm of web development, this project holds a special place in my journey. It was designed to challenge my skills in handling real-time updates and to deepen my understanding of Vue through practical application.

## 📚 Learnings
- Mastered the art of creating and utilizing Vue components
- Learned to design interactive toggles that dynamically alter content
- Honed skills in processing user inputs and passing arguments into components/functions
- Gained valuable insights into UX/UI design, focusing on user needs and preferences

## 🤔 Future plans
Given more time, I'd love to enhance user customization by offering options for personalized color schemes and font selections. Another exciting avenue could be transforming this tracker into a Progressive Web App (PWA), making it conveniently accessible on mobile devices.
